This is a localhost demo of our rideshare app RideLink.

Say you are driving from your current location in College Station, TX to Houston, TX. If your vehicle has extra seats, you can use RideLink to make money from those seats. Drivers can earn extra cash and riders and travel cheaply and efficient to and from. This leads to lower emissions, similar to taking the bus or carpooling to work.

To run this have npm and node.js installed then run:

```bash
npm i
nodemon
```
